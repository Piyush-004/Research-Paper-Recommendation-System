# Research-Paper-Recommendation-System

MyResearchPal is a research paper recommendation system designed to assist researchers by recommending relevant papers based on their interests and predicting the subject area of each paper. The system utilizes a hybrid model that combines semantic search with machine learning algorithms, using Sentence Transformers for embedding and retrieval, and a neural network for subject area classification. Built using Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, MyResearchPal employs a dataset of 'archiv_paper' from Kaggle, including titles, abstracts, and subject categories, to train and evaluate the model.
